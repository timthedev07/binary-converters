# Binary Converters

Some shitty programs just to brush up on my understanding of binary conversions.

## Supported conversions

formats = "unsigned-binary" | "signed-binary" | "twos-complement" | "denary"

from:

- `signed-binary` to `denary`
- `signed-binary` to `twos-complement`

- `unsigned-binary` to `denary`
- `denary` to `unsigned-binary` (for positive denary values only)

## Usage

```bash
python converter.py
```
